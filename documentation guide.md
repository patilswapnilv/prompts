# The Complete Guide to AI-First Documentation for Building Apps

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 2025-02-05

## Introduction

This guide provides best practices and detailed prompts for generating the six canonical documents that form your project’s knowledge base before writing any code. Each document serves a specific purpose in eliminating AI hallucinations and ensuring consistent, predictable builds.

-----

## Document 1: PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)

### Purpose

Your contract with AI. Defines **what** you’re building, **who** it’s for, and **what success looks like**. No ambiguity allowed.

### Best Practices from Research

- Start with user goals and problems, not features
- Include explicit out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep (OUT OF SCOPE lives only in the PRD—other docs should reference PRD §7 rather than duplicating it)
- Use SMART criteria for success metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Keep it concise but comprehensive (modern PRDs are blog-post length, not 37-page docs)
- Make it a living document that evolves with the product
- Use clear, specific language—avoid vague terms
- Include user stories in “As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]” format

### Checklist for PRD §7 OUT OF SCOPE

Before finalizing the PRD, confirm:

- [ ] **Section 7 exists** and is titled "Explicitly OUT OF SCOPE" (or equivalent).
- [ ] **You listed what you will NOT build**—at least 3–5 concrete items (e.g. "No user accounts", "No mobile app", "No real-time sync").
- [ ] **You said no to common creep items** that might tempt scope expansion (e.g. admin dashboard, email notifications, export to PDF, dark mode, offline support)—only if they are truly out of scope for this version.
- [ ] **Wording is specific** (not "We might skip X" but "X is out of scope for MVP").
- [ ] **Other docs will reference PRD §7** rather than duplicating the list (single source of truth).

### Sample AI Prompt for PRD Generation

```
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for [YOUR APP IDEA].

Context:
- Target Users: [WHO]
- Main Problem: [WHAT PROBLEM]
- Unique Value: [WHY THIS SOLUTION]

Structure the PRD with these sections:

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a clear, specific problem statement that describes the user pain point or business need.

2. GOALS & OBJECTIVES
Define 3-5 SMART goals with specific, measurable targets.

3. SUCCESS METRICS
Identify 3-5 quantifiable metrics to measure success (e.g., "30% reduction in task completion time").

4. TARGET PERSONAS
Create 2 detailed user personas with:
- Demographics
- Pain points
- Goals
- Technical proficiency level

5. FEATURES & REQUIREMENTS
Organize features into three tiers:
- P0 (Must-Have): Core features required for MVP
- P1 (Should-Have): Important but not critical for launch
- P2 (Nice-to-Have): Future enhancements

For each feature, include:
- Clear description
- User story format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- 3-5 acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Success metric

6. EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE
List 5-10 things you will NOT build in this version. Be specific.

7. USER SCENARIOS
Create 3 detailed end-to-end scenarios showing:
- Context (when does this happen)

- Expected outcomes
- Edge cases and error handling

8. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Specify performance, security, accessibility, and scalability requirements.

9. DEPENDENCIES & CONSTRAINTS
List technical and business constraints, external dependencies (APIs, services).

10. TIMELINE
Define MVP and V1.0 milestone dates with included features.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use specific, measurable criteria (not vague)
- Avoid technical implementation details
- Focus on WHAT to build, not HOW to build it
- Make every requirement testable
- Include edge cases and error states
- Be explicit about what's NOT included

OUTPUT FORMAT: Markdown document with clear headers and bullet points.
```

-----

## Document 2: APP_FLOW.md (Application Flow & Navigation)

### Purpose

Maps every page, every user path, every decision point. Prevents AI from guessing navigation patterns.

### Best Practices from Research

- Start with user goals, not pages
- Document entry points explicitly (how users arrive)
- Show decision points and branching logic
- Include success paths AND error states
- Keep flows focused on single goals (one flow per task)
- Use visual flowchart standards (shapes have meaning)
- Document what triggers each flow

### Structure Template

```
# Application Flow Documentation

## 1. Entry Points
### Primary Entry Points
- **Direct URL**: [What happens when user types URL]
- **Landing Page**: [What the user sees first]
- **Deep Links**: [From email, notifications, ads]
- **OAuth/Social Login**: [Third-party entry points]

### Secondary Entry Points
- **Search Engine**: [SEO landing pages]
- **Marketing Campaigns**: [Campaign-specific entry]

## 2. Core User Flows

### Flow 1: [Flow Name - e.g., "User Registration"]
**Goal**: [What user is trying to accomplish]
**Entry Point**: [Where flow starts]
**Frequency**: [How often this happens]

#### Happy Path
1. **Page: Landing Page**
   - Elements: [Hero section, CTA button]
   - User Action: Clicks "Sign Up"
   - Trigger: Navigate to registration page
   
2. **Page: Registration Form**
   - Elements: [Email input, Password input, Submit button]
   - User Actions: 
     - Enters email
     - Enters password (with validation)
   - Validation: 
     - Email format check
     - Password strength requirements
   - Trigger: Submits form
   
3. **System Action**: Creates user account
   
4. **Page: Email Verification**
   - Elements: [Verification message, Resend link]
   - User Action: Clicks verification link in email
   
5. **Page: Welcome Dashboard**
   - Elements: [Onboarding checklist, Quick actions]
   - Success State: User is logged in and onboarded

#### Error States
- **Invalid Email**
  - Display: Inline error message
  - Action: User corrects and resubmits
  
- **Email Already Exists**
  - Display: Modal with login link
  - Action: Redirect to login
  
- **Weak Password**
  - Display: Password strength indicator
  - Action: User strengthens password

#### Edge Cases
- User closes browser mid-registration → Save form data, show "Continue" on return
- Email verification link expires → Provide resend option
- User registers but doesn't verify → Send reminder after 24 hours

#### Exit Points
- Success: Dashboard (logged in)
- Abandonment: Close/navigate away
- Redirect: Login page if account exists

## 3. Navigation Map

### Primary Navigation
```

Home
├── Products
│   ├── Category 1
│   │   └── Product Detail
│   │       ├── Add to Cart
│   │       └── Reviews
│   └── Category 2
├── Cart
│   ├── Checkout
│   │   ├── Shipping Info
│   │   ├── Payment
│   │   └── Order Confirmation
│   └── Continue Shopping → Products
├── Account
│   ├── Profile
│   ├── Orders
│   └── Settings
└── Support

```
### Navigation Rules
- **Authentication Required**: [Pages that require login]
- **Redirect Logic**: [When to redirect to login, when to show modal]
- **Back Button Behavior**: [Which pages preserve state]

## 4. Screen Inventory

### Screen: [Screen Name]
- **Route**: `/path/to/screen`
- **Access**: [Public/Authenticated/Admin]
- **Purpose**: [What user accomplishes here]
- **Key Elements**:

  - [Element 2]
- **Actions Available**:
  - [Action 1] → Leads to [Screen/State]
  - [Action 2] → Leads to [Screen/State]
- **State Variants**: [Loading, Empty, Error, Success]

## 5. Interaction Patterns

### Pattern: Form Submission
- Validation: Client-side (instant) + Server-side (on submit)
- Loading State: Disabled button, spinner
- Success: Redirect OR inline success message
- Error: Inline error messages, keep form data

### Pattern: Infinite Scroll
- Trigger: User scrolls to 80% of page
- Loading: Skeleton screens
- End: "No more items" message

## 6. Decision Points

### Decision: User Authentication Status
```

IF user is NOT logged in
THEN show: Login CTA
AND disable: Account features
ELSE IF user IS logged in
THEN show: Account menu
AND enable: Full features

```
### Decision: Cart State
```

IF cart is empty
THEN show: “Start Shopping” CTA
ELSE IF cart has items
THEN show: Checkout button
AND display: Item count badge

```
## 7. Error Handling Flows

### 404 Not Found
- Display: Custom 404 page
- Actions: Search, Home link, Popular pages
- Log: 404 errors for fixing broken links

### 500 Server Error
- Display: Friendly error page
- Actions: Retry button, Support contact
- Fallback: Save user's work if possible

### Network Offline
- Display: Offline banner
- Actions: Queue actions for later
- Recovery: Auto-retry when online

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Mobile-Specific Flows
- Navigation: Hamburger menu instead of top nav
- Forms: One field per screen
- Actions: Bottom sheet for selections

### Desktop-Specific Flows
- Navigation: Full menu visible
- Forms: Multi-column layouts
- Actions: Modals for quick actions

## 9. Animation & Transitions

### Page Transitions
- **Navigation**: Fade in/out (300ms)
- **Modal**: Slide up from bottom (200ms)
- **Drawer**: Slide from side (250ms)

### Micro-interactions
- **Button Click**: Scale(0.95) + Ripple
- **Form Focus**: Border highlight
- **Success**: Checkmark animation
```

5. DECISION POINTS
Document every conditional in the flow using IF-THEN logic:
```

IF [condition]
THEN [action/display]
ELSE IF [condition]
THEN [action/display]
ELSE
THEN [default action]

```
Examples:
- Authentication checks
- Feature availability
- Permission levels
- Cart/basket state
- Form validation

6. ERROR HANDLING
Document flows for:
- 404 errors
- 500 errors
- Network offline
- Permission denied
- Form validation failures

For each: Display shown, user actions available, system recovery

7. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
Specify how flows differ on:
- Mobile (touch interactions, simplified nav)
- Tablet
- Desktop (full features)

8. ANIMATIONS & TRANSITIONS
Document:
- Page transitions (duration, easing)
- Modal/drawer behavior
- Loading states
- Success animations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Every user action must have a clear next step
- Document BOTH success and failure paths
- Include specific validation rules
- Specify error message wording
- Show state transitions explicitly
- Use consistent naming (match PRD.md features)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Markdown with clear headers, indented lists for hierarchy, code blocks for decision logic.

- **Large text** (18pt+): 3:1 minimum
- **UI components**: 3:1 minimum

#### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators must be visible (2px outline)
- Tab order must be logical

#### Screen Readers

- Use semantic HTML (button, nav, main, etc.)
- Provide alt text for images
- Use aria-labels for icon buttons
- Announce dynamic content changes

#### Forms

- Associate labels with inputs (htmlFor/id)
- Provide helpful error messages
- Mark required fields clearly
- Group related fields (fieldset/legend)

-----

## 6. Animation Guidelines

### Transitions

```css
/* Default transition */
transition: all 200ms ease-in-out;

/* Color transitions */
transition-property: background-color, border-color, color;
transition-duration: 200ms;

/* Transform transitions */
transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
```

### Usage Rules

- Keep animations under 300ms
- Use easing: ease-in-out for most animations
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Animate only transform and opacity for performance

-----

## 7. Icon System

### Icon Library

- **Library**: Lucide React
- **Size**: 16px (sm), 20px (base), 24px (lg)
- **Stroke Width**: 2px (default)

### Usage

import { Mail, Send } from 'lucide-react';

<Mail className="w-5 h-5" />
<Send className="w-5 h-5 text-primary-500" />
```

-----

## 8. State Indicators

### Loading States

```jsx
{/* Skeleton */}
<div className="animate-pulse">
  <div className="h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded w-3/4 mb-2"></div>
  <div className="h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded w-1/2"></div>
</div>

{/* Spinner */}
<div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-primary-500"></div>
```

### Empty States

```jsx
<div className="text-center py-12">
  <Icon className="w-12 h-12 text-neutral-400 mx-auto mb-3" />
  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-neutral-900 mb-1">
    No items yet
  </h3>
  <p className="text-neutral-500 mb-4">
    Get started by creating your first item
  </p>
  <button className="primary-button">
    Create Item
  </button>
</div>
```

### Error States

```jsx
<div className="bg-error/10 border border-error text-error px-4 py-3 rounded-md">
  <p className="font-medium">Error</p>
  <p className="text-sm">Something went wrong. Please try again.</p>
</div>
```

-----

## 9. Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach

```css
/* Base styles for mobile */
.component {
  width: 100%;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .component {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .component {
    width: 33.333%;
  }
}
```

### Touch Targets

- Provide width/height to prevent layout shift
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallback)
- Lazy load images below fold

### Code Splitting

- Lazy load routes
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Defer non-critical JavaScript

-----

## 11. Browser Support

### Supported Browsers

- Chrome (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Edge (last 2 versions)

### Progressive Enhancement

- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced features for modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

*[Due to length constraints, I'll provide Documents 5 and 6 (BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) in my next response. Would you like me to continue with those now?]*

## Document 5: BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md (Backend Architecture & Database Schema)

### Purpose
Database schema, API contracts, authentication logic. Every table, every relationship, every endpoint.

### Best Practices from Research
- Define schema before implementation
- Document relationships clearly (ERDs helpful)
- Specify exact data types and constraints
- Don't mirror database structure in API (use abstraction layer)
- Focus on business logic, not just CRUD
- Document authentication flow
- Include API versioning strategy
- Define validation rules

### Structure Template
```

# Backend Architecture & Database Structure

## 1. Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

- **Pattern**: RESTful API with server-side rendering (SSR)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with HTTP-only cookies
- **Data Flow**: Client → API Gateway → Business Logic → Database
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for sessions and frequent queries

-----

## 2. Database Schema

### Database: PostgreSQL 16.1

- **ORM**: Prisma 5.8.1
- **Naming Convention**: snake_case for tables/columns
- **Timestamps**: All tables have created_at, updated_at

### Entity Relationship Diagram

[ASCII or description of relationships]

-----

- Reset via email verification only

-----

## 6. Data Validation Rules

### Email Validation

```javascript
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
// Additional checks:
// - Max length: 255 chars
// - No disposable email domains
// - Must be unique in database
```

// - Length: 8-128 characters
// - At least 1 uppercase letter
// - At least 1 lowercase letter
// - At least 1 number
// - At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)
// - No common passwords (check against list)
```

### Content Sanitization

- Strip HTML tags from user input
- Allow markdown in post content
- Sanitize before storage and before display
- Max lengths enforced at DB level

-----

## 7. Error Handling

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Email already exists"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: 400
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: 401
- `FORBIDDEN`: 403
- `NOT_FOUND`: 404
- `CONFLICT`: 409
- `RATE_LIMITED`: 429
- `SERVER_ERROR`: 500

-----

## 8. Caching Strategy

### Cache Layers

1. **Redis** (most frequent)
- User sessions
- API rate limits
- Frequently accessed posts
1. **Database Query Cache**
- Prisma query caching
- TTL: 5 minutes

### Cache Keys

- Sessions: `session:{refresh_token}`
- Posts list: `posts:list:page:{page}:sort:{sort}`
- Post detail: `post:slug:{slug}`
- User profile: `user:id:{user_id}`

### Cache Invalidation

- On UPDATE: Invalidate related cache keys
- On DELETE: Invalidate + remove from cache
- On CREATE: Invalidate list caches

-----

## 9. Rate Limiting

### Limits by Endpoint

- Login: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Register: 3 requests per hour per IP
- API (authenticated): 100 requests per minute
- API (public): 50 requests per minute

### Implementation

- Store in Redis with sliding window
- Return 429 with Retry-After header
- Block IP after 10 consecutive 429s

-----

## 10. Database Migrations

### Migration Strategy

- Use Prisma Migrate
- Never edit migrations after deployed
- Always create new migration for changes
- Test on staging before production

### Migration Process

```bash
# 1. Create migration
prisma migrate dev --name add_posts_table

# 2. Test locally

# 3. Deploy to staging
prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Test on staging

# 5. Deploy to production
prisma migrate deploy
```

-----

## 11. Backup & Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Frequency**: Daily automated backups at 2 AM UTC
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Location**: AWS S3 with encryption
- **Type**: Full database dump + WAL archiving

### Recovery Procedure

1. Identify backup timestamp
1. Restore from S3
1. Apply WAL logs if needed
1. Verify data integrity
1. Update application config
1. Test critical paths

-----

## 12. API Versioning

### Current Version: v1

### Versioning Strategy

- URL-based: `/api/v1/posts`
- No version in URL defaults to v1
- Maintain backwards compatibility for 6 months
- Deprecation warnings in headers

### Breaking Changes

- Announce 3 months in advance
- Provide migration guide
- Support old version during transition
- Monitor usage before deprecation

```

## Conclusion

These six documents form your complete knowledge base. When AI reads them:

1. **PRD.md** tells it WHAT to build
2. **APP_FLOW.md** tells it HOW users navigate
3. **TECH_STACK.md** tells it WHICH tools to use
4. **FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md** tells it HOW it should look
5. **BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md** tells it HOW data works
6. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** tells it WHAT ORDER to build

Together, they eliminate hallucinations and ensure AI builds exactly what you specified.

---

## Using These Documents

### Before Every AI Coding Session:
1. Give AI relevant docs as context
2. Reference specific sections
3. Ask AI to confirm understanding
4. Build iteratively, testing each step

### Example Prompt:
```

I have complete documentation for my project. Please review:

1. PRD.md - focus on [Feature X]
1. APP_FLOW.md - review the [User Flow Y]
1. TECH_STACK.md - we’re using [Tech Z version]
1. FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md - follow [Component Guidelines]
1. BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md - implement [Endpoint A]

Based on these docs, implement [Feature X] following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Step 4.2.

Do not deviate from the specifications. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous.

```
This is documentation-first development. Your project stays on track because AI has no room to guess.
